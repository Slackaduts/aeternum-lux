2. LICENSING

2.1. Executable Licensed Work (including, but not limited to, games and software) is provided for
personal and recreational use only. Unless otherwise noted, executable Licensed Work may not be
used in commercial derived works. If source code for executable Licensed Work is provided, whether
as part of the executable Licensed Work or as a separate product, that source code is resource
Licensed Work.
Rendering executable Licensed Work unable to execute, with means including but not limited to changing
its file extension, revoking file system execute permissions, or removing essential system libraries,
does not render the Licensed Work a resource Licensed Work. You may not translate, reverse engineer,
decompile, or disassemble the executable Licensed Work except to the extent applicable law specifically
prohibits such restriction. You must prohibit your affiliates from translating, reverse engineering,
decompiling, or disassembling the executable Licensed Work, except to the extent applicable law
specifically prohibits such restriction.

2.1.1. Do NOT:
(i) Copy, modify, merge, distribute, translate, rent, lend, lease, reverse engineer, decompile,
disassemble or create derivative works of it.
(ii) Hack, harm, grief or misuse them or use any viruses or other harmful software in connection with
them.
(iii) Create or use exploits, automation software (aka 'bots') or other software or do anything else
to give you an unfair advantage regarding them (or try to circumvent or harm software meant to stop
these things).
(iv) Interfere with them or their network software or other software including via tunneling, code
injection, modifying or changing the software, using any other software together with them, through
protocol emulation or through creation or use of private servers regarding them. 
(v) Use them to access, copy, transfer, transcode or retransmit content in breach of any laws or
third party rights.
(vi) Remove, obscure or alter Kazan Games' or any third party's copyright, trade mark or other
proprietary notices or documentation regarding them, nor use any Kazan Games or other trademarks
for your own purposes.
(vii) Do not use for the targeted harassment or defamation of any individual, group, or entity, or in
anyway that is illegal. This includes masked words (---), acronyms and abbreviations.
(viii) Submit personal information of other persons without their consent.

2.2. Resource Licensed Work (including, but not limited to, source code/assets, sound effects, music and
graphics) may be used to create derivative works, commercial and otherwise, provided the derivative work
is in a non-resource form not intended to be further edited by its end user (including, but not limited
to, game executable, digital or physical book, movie, software (machine-readable) object code).
Credit to FoxyOfJungle within a derivative work is appreciated but not mandatory. You must not endorse
or say that it was made by Kazan Games. The rights to intellectual properties used in derivative works
stay with their intellectual property rights holders. You must NOT redistribute the project source
(and any part of it, including, but NOT limited: shaders, code and sprites), as it will be considered
copyright infringement. Only distribution of binary executables created by GameMaker are accepted.
From the moment that someone has access to the source code, even if temporary, the person can copy the
files, which means there must be a non-distribution agreement between you and the parties. See item 12
of this Agreement for more information. When obtaining the product, the purchase is valid for a single
commercial project. For every new published commercial project, you must obtain a new copy of the asset.
This requirement is valid only for purchases made through Itch.io website.


3. PROPRIETARY REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Licensed Work may be provided in proprietary formats, including but not limited to GameMaker
exported project file format. Kazan Games is not obligated to provide non-proprietary versions of
Licensed Work, and use of Licensed Work requires lawful possession of the proprietary tool, IDE, or
licenses required to use such Licensed Work. Kazan Games may not be held liable for damages arising
due to use of third-party tools or IDEs manipulating or using Licensed Work, whether proprietary or
otherwise.


4. THIRD-PARTY LICENSES.

4.1. You are solely responsible for obtaining licenses for any relevant third-party material for
your use in connection with technology that you incorporate into the your product (whether as part
of the Licensed Work or not), including but not limited to proprietary format file manipulation tools,
storefront API licenses, and intellectual properties featured in derived works. This applies if the
Work is primarily a source code.


5. TERM AND TERMINATION.

5.1. User is considered to have terminated this Agreement immediately at the completion of a refund
of the Licensed Work.

5.2. Upon termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted will expire.

suggestions regarding the Licensed Work. Kazan Games has no obligation to respond to such a problem
report or suggestion. Kazan Games may make changes to the Licensed Work at any time, without any
obligation to notify or provide updated versions of the Licensed Work to you. Therefore, it is

performance of the Licensed Work, or any systems you design using the Licensed Work (if any).


8. INDEMNITY

8.1. You agree that in serious cases of copyright infringement and breach of this License Agreement,
caused by you (including, but not limited to, after distributing source code), you are subject to
indemnify Kazan Games for such damages (both financial and moral).

8.2. Licensed Work (collectively referred to as "items") is subject to the export control laws of
the United States and other countries that may lawfully control the export of the Licensed Work.
Furnishing support services with respect to Licensed Work that is controlled as defense or military
items may also be subject to such laws. Accordingly, you agree you will not transfer the Licensed
Work or furnish such services except in compliance with the export laws of the United States and
any other country that may lawfully control the export of the Licensed Work or the provision of
such services.  You will indemnify and hold Kazan Games harmless from any claims, liabilities,
damages, penalties, forfeitures, and associated costs and expenses (including, but not limited to,
attorneys' fees) that Kazan Games may incur due to your non-compliance with applicable export laws,
rules, and regulations. You will immediately notify Kazan Games of any violation of any export law,
rule, or regulation, which may affect Kazan Games or relate to the activities covered under this
Agreement. If an export or import license, permit, or other government required authority is required
for transfer of the Licensed Work under this Agreement, and such authorization is not approved, then
Kazan Games is not obligated to proceed with the transfer until required government authorization is
granted.


9. LIABILITY

9.1. IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
DAMAGES FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF TIME, INCONVENIENCE, COMMERCIAL LOSS, OR LOST PROFITS, SAVINGS,
OR REVENUES, TO THE FULL EXTENT SUCH MAY BE DISCLAIMED BY LAW.  KAZAN GAMES'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR
ALL COSTS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS, OR LOSSES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT
OR PRODUCT(S) SUPPLIED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO KAZAN
GAMES IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSED STUFF TO WHICH LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARE CLAIMED.


10. CHANGES TO THIS USER AGREEMENT

10.1. We may change this User Agreement if we consider it necessary (for example to reflect changes in
the Work or legal developments). If so, we will make the revised version available online and
make reasonable efforts to inform you of changes. It will become legally binding on you once we
post it online. If you do not agree to the new version, you must stop using the Work completely
- in order to make the "Work" work properly we need to have everyone using this under the same
rules instead of different people having different rules.


11. FINAL AGREEMENT

11.1 If you use "the Work" created by Kazan Games, you need to follow this license agreement.
If you change your mind, you need to delete all the files from everywhere.
Subject to the license agreement and restrictions contained herein, you agree that you are fully
responsible for any financial damage caused by third parties due to non-permanent access to
source code for which they were not acquired through direct purchase (including, but not limited,
source code). You (and your team/company, if that's the case) must treat the Licensed Work as
confidential information and agree to retain the Licensed Work in confidence perpetually, or for
a period of five (10) years after the termination of this Agreement.


12. IGNORANCE OF TERMS

12.1. Failure to fully read or understand the terms in this Agreement is not to be considered valid
grounds for failure to uphold them, except to the extent applicable law specifically prohibits such
restriction. Consent to the Agreement is considered to explicitly state that the terms of the Agreement
have been fully read and understood.
